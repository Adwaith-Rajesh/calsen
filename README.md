A search engine for local files

---

Currently WIP anything can change at any time.

## Why ...

I just wanted to a search to engine to search through my files, Because I'm really good at organizing them.

Why rewrite the [previous project](https://github.com/Adwaith-Rajesh/calsen/tree/main) in `V`

- The previous was a bit unstable, even though it never crashed I have this weird feeling that it will.
- V offers some great features that I was implementing it by hand (hash tables, lists, string ...etc).
- and, last but not the least, I have 0 experience in V
